Hash Set uses hast table to store data.
Hash set has O(1) time complexity for insert, remove, search.
Hash Set is faster than Tree Set
Hash set contains null object.
Hash Set is an unordered Data structure
Hash Set uses equal() method to compare two object in set and find duplicate.


Tree Set uses tree map to store data
Tree Set has O(logn) complexity
Tree Set is slower than Hash Set
Tree Set contains data in sorted order
Tree Set does not contains null object
Tree Set uses compareTo() method to compare the object between two sets.
