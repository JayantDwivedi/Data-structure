#Introduction to Hashing
### HashTable
It is a data structure that offer very fast insertion, deletion 
and searching. No matter how many data item there are 
,Insertion and serching (and somethimes deletion) can take close
to constant time O(1).

### Some Characteristic of Hash Table
- It is fast insertion, searching, sometimes deletion.
- It require hash function

### Hints 
- Employee data store example in various type of Data Structures
- Conversion of string to digits 
- Clustering problem
- Collision problem 
- Squeeze the size using %(mod) operator

### Methods to Remove Collision
- Open Chaining :- linear probing qurdeatic probing



### Uses of Hash Table
- Used in compiler design which maintains a 'symbol table'
- Symbol table is the table which hold the function along with 
the address in memory.
